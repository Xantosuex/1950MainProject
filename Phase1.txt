Phase 1: Definition
(test)
Gathering Information
-	We know what the client’s product information is.
-	All content is provided to us via the current COMP1950 site
-	I think we’re all “experts” in our client’s business

Client Questionnaire
-	To be reviewed in meeting
-	See summarized version in Desmond’s email

Audience
-	See project plan

Setting Goals
-	We are designing the website to better meet the student’s needs
-	We only need a proto site
-	We want to deliver content in a more efficient manner. Current website clumps blocks of content together. Mass amounts of texts could make content delivery difficult.
-	We want to divide content so it can be taken in more easily.
-	Adding some limited visual eye candy could make the site more enjoyable to be on.
-	We want the student to be able to gather information quickly. Use the click-count rule for navigation. Ex: 4 clicks from home page to week 5’s lecture notes.

Creative Brief
-	In order to complete the project, we must provide a proto site for a redesign of Alistair’s class website for COMP1950 in order to better meet the student’s needs.
-	To meet the student’s needs, a student needs to be able to quickly find and quickly take in content and information provided by the website. After all, that’s what a student needs from being on the site.

AUDIENCE
-	The target audience are the students of COMP1950
-	Ages may vary, but generally young adults
-	Mixed gender
-	Mixed ethnic groups
-	Financial status may vary, but students are generally poor
-	Expected to be somewhat familiar with technology due to the course’s two required prerequisites, COMP1002 and COMP1850
-	Current site does serve the purpose, however it lacks flavor and is pretty boring. The decision from Alistair to redesign the website is a smart one.

TESTING PLAN
-	Test the site ourselves to see how easy it is to obtain information from the site
-	Use the click count rule
-	Test for any bugs in the code
-	Review to see if site matches goal

DETAILS AND ASSUMPTIONS
-	All content will be provided by the current COMP1950 site
-	All team members will be present at all meetings
-	Design must be finalized before coding can even begin
-	MORE CAN BE ADDED TO THIS.
