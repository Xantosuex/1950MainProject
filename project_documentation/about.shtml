		<h1>About the COMP 10950 Proto-site</h1>
			<p>The methods used in web design and development methodology are very similar to methods used in the sales process. The overall processes are also analogous in more abstract ways. One key similarity is the principle that the more time spent on the initial stages of the cycle converts to less time spent on the final stages of the project. With this in mind, we spent a considerable amount of time planning and gaining agreement on many details of the project before we began coding.</p>
			<h2>Wireframes</h2>
			<p>Once we had a clear idea of the project requirements, we drew out plans for layout and menus. This was key as it determined how content would be presented. Our objectives were to have layout as consistent and concise as possible. The focus was on lesson material and content navigation. We decided to include examples and exercises in the lesson notes as it facilitated coherence. We also included a quick-nav (menu) in each lesson page in order allow for quick jumps between each topic. This becomes especially important when accommodating for smaller screen sizes (up to a max width of 639px) where scrolling through large amounts of content can become cumbersome. We also accommodate towards users viewing the site from a medium sized screen (min-width: 641px) and users viewing it from a regular desktop screen (our optimal conditions).</p>
			<p>We used Tumblr for the Professor’s blog. This allowed us to capitalize on Tumblrs’ update/post GUI; allowing us to provide a very easy method of managing frequently changing content. Though we did not develop it, we did discuss having a student discussion forum as well. We did not reach clear consensus, but most of us found it of value to have a place for students to post questions and discuss course content amongst themselves. While there are no shortages in the amount of online resources (Google, stack overflow etc.), the idea of having a place where students were in the same learning environment and under the same set circumstances help put any issues or questions they might have into a relatable context.</p>
			<h2>Style</h2>
			<p>Once we had developed an idea of how we would organize content, we briefly discussed style.  We referred to <a href='http://www.bcit.ca/marcom/styleguide/'>BCIT Writing Style Guide</a> in order to ensure we were compliant with guidelines. It was important for us, that the proto-site’s aesthetic design be visually recognizable as part of BCIT. Out of all of BCIT’s major areas of studies, the School of Computing and Information Technology was the category we found to be most suitable to place COMP 1950 course under. We referenced BCIT’s Graphic Standards Manual for the official department colors and constructed an appropriate complimentary color scheme for the proto-site accordingly.</p>
			<p>The major typeface utilized in the proto-site is Roboto, an open type family designed for high resolution viewing on digital screens. It is a large typeface family with many different weights and styles to choose from (including Roboto Condensed and Roboto Slab) allowing for a flexible range of applications whilst still maintaining cohesive unity.</p>
			<h2>Coding</h2>
			<p>From there we divided the work amongst ourselves, each team member was designated with a certain set of responsibilities. We decided to segregate tasks in order to focus on specific areas without getting in each others’ way. With a clear plan and a shared vision, we were confident everything would come together as detailed on our notes.</p>
			<p>This site is the definition of organization, innovative layout and responsive design. It also just rocks overall.</p>
