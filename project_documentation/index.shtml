		<h1>IT Sensations Home</h1>
			<h2>Introdiction to the Protosite</h2>
				<p>This project is a COMP1950 website redesign.  Though there are some good features of the existing site, it is failing in its primary focus: To present information to students in a way that facilitates learning.  The way that lessons are organized (chronologically) is good, but it is lacking in additional material, such as code repositories, examples and exercises.</p>
		
				<p>Though the core audience is existing students, it would be nice to acknowledge prospective students and alumni.  The new site should better help keep students up-to-date on breaking news and it should be easy to maintain.  The new site should also look nice and use modern web design techniques taught in the class itsâ€™ self.</p>

			<h2>Project Goals</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Create a repository of information for students</li>
					<li>Should acknowledge prospective students and alumni</li>
					<li>Should cover breaking news and be easy to maintain</li>
				</ul>
