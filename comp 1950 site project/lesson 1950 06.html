			<h2>CSS Question Groups</h2>
			<div class="content-block">

			<p>Building proper CSS-based layouts requires an understanding of how positioning works, which is based largely on the Box Model concept.</p>

			<p>How did you do?</p>

			<p>What do you think of CSS so far?</p>

			<h3>Answer Group</h3>
			<p>CSS is a very difficult concept to teach in it's entirety. Best to introduce a number of concepts and let you build knowledge on those concepts.</p>
			
			<p>To better understand what you know and what you don't, we're going to try a <strong>question group</strong>:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Get together in groups of 4 or so</li>
				<li>What are you having problems with? Is there a particular aspect that is a mystery?</li>
				<li>Does someone in your group have expertise?</li>
				<li>See what mysteries you can unlock with your peers</li>
				<li>Any common issues in your group? Choose your top 1 or 2</li>
				
			</ul>

<h2><a id="ssi" name="ssi">What are Server Side Includes?</a></h2>

<div class="content-block"><p>A server function that allows for real-time echoing of information to the browser such as: 

<ul>
	<li>Time </li>
	<li>Date </li>
	<li>file information </li>
	<li>conditional execution of documents </li>
	<li>even sending an e-mail </li>
</ul>
 </p>
</div>

<h2>How do they work?</h2>
<div class="content-block">
<ul>
	<li>A series of characters (called tokens) are included in your HTML </li>
	<li>As page is processed by the HTTP server, any tokens are sent to the SSI engine </li>
	<li>The processed result is then either output as HTML, or some server side function is instantiated. </li>
</ul>
 

<h3>Can be a powerful tool for web development:</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Further lightens your code.  A small SSI statement can take the place of a large, re-used codeblock</li>
	<li>This can save giant amounts of code footprint on your site!</li>
	<li>Code changes made easy.  If you have your navigation built into an SSI, you can make 1 change and all pages that subscribe to that SSI will change.</li>
	<li>Execute script and applications within HTML.  If you need to have live data on your site, you can write a mini-application that will execute each time you deliver a page.  BCIT's navigation system runs on this.</li>
</ul>
</div>
 

<h2>What do they look like?</h2>

<div class="content-block"><p>
	Each SSI Token has the following 4 pieces:

	<ol>
	<li><strong>&lt;!--#</strong> Opening identifier </li>
	<li><strong>{tag}</strong> is one of the following actions: 
		<ul><li>echo </li>
		<li>include </li>
		<li>fsize </li>
		<li>flastmod </li>
		<li>exec </li>
		<li>config </li>
		<li>odbc </li>
		<li>email </li>
		<li>if </li>
		<li>goto </li>
		<li>label </li>
		<li>break </li></ul></li>
	<li> <strong>{variable set}</strong> can be any number of things based on attribute="variable" <br>
	Each tag has a different set of valid attributes and variables </li>
	<li><strong>--&gt;</strong> Closing identifier </li>
</ol>
 </div>

<h2>What are the most common?</h2>

<div class="content-block"><p>The <strong>ECHO</strong> tag is one of the most common, allowing you to include a wide variety of document information: 
<ul>
	<li><strong>DOCUMENT_NAME:</strong> The current filename. </li>
	<li><strong>DOCUMENT_URI:</strong> The virtual path to this document (such as /docs/tutorials/foo.shtml). </li>
	<li><strong>DATE_LOCAL:</strong> The current date, local time zone. Subject to the timefmt parameter to the config command. </li>
	<li><strong>DATE_GMT:</strong> Same as DATE_LOCAL but in Greenwich mean time. </li>
	<li><strong>LAST_MODIFIED:</strong> The last modification date of the current document. Subject to timefmt like the others. </li>
	<li>The <strong>EXEC</strong> tag allows you to execute code (such as PHP or PERL) while the HTML itself is being processed.  </li>
	<li>The <strong>INCLUDE</strong> tag is likely the most common. It allows you to include documents or document fragments right in your HTML.  <em>This is what we will be doing today.</em></li>
</ul> </p>


<h3>Are there any requirements?</h3>

<p>Yes! There are a few:

<ul>
	<li>Your server must have the SSI module activated (there are SSI modules for almost every web server in existence) </li>
	<li>Sometimes you may need to use a different extension on your HTML (usually SHTML) so that the server will understand that it needs to process embedded SSIs</li>
</ul> </p>
 

 

<h3>Best practice</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Comment your SSIs in your code so that you know wherre they are supposed to be (especially if they don't work!)</li>
	<li>Place all SSIs in a single location with a common extension that is *not* HTML or XHTML.  This is so that you know what they are and what they are used for</li>
	<li>Additionally, putting them in their own directory (like: <code>/inc</code>) helps: easier to find and always in a &quot;known&quot; spot</li>
	<li>Common usage: <code>/inc/date.inc</code> or <code>/inc/nav.inc</code></li>
</ul>

<h2>Exercise</h2>
<div class="content-block">
<p>Using a basic SSI for including a file, replace your navigation from your Personal Page with an SSI</p>
<ul>
	<li>Remove your Navigation from your TheNet Site</li>
	<li>Place it in a file to be included (like: /inc/nav.inc)</li>
	<li>Use an SSI to include it in each page of your TheNet Site</li>
</ul>


</div>

<h2>SSI Exercise</h2>
<div class="content-block">
<p>You will be creating 3 files to be used throughout your site: one each for header, footer and navigation and including them as SSIs on each page.</p>

<p>Create 3 files (XHTML Fragments) for these includes:</p>

<ol>
	<li>A header file (head.inc) that will display at the top of each page</li>
	<li>A footer file (foot.inc) that will display at the bottom of each page</li>
	<li>A navigation file (nav.inc) that will show up where you want it to</li>
</ol>

<p>Make sure the files are <em>HTML 5</em>!</p> 

<p>Create a directory called <strong>inc</strong> and place all three files inside there.</p>


<p>Don't worry about style or markup right now.  These files can be pretty plain, but remember, they are going to live inside your HTML.</p>
 
<p>We will do the including after you have created the files.</p>
</div>

<h2>Header  (head.inc)</h2>
<div class="content-block">
<h3>Build a header that makes sense for your site</h3>

<p>Perhaps a title you will use throughout the site</p>

<p>Example Code:<br>

&lt;h1 class="header"&gt;COMP 1950 : Alistair Calder&lt;/h1&gt;
</p>
</div> 

<h2>Footer (foot.inc)</h2>
<div class="content-block">
<h3>Build a footer that makes sense for your site</h3>


<p>Example Code:<br>

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p class="footer"&gt;

&copy; 2013 Alistair Calder | 

&lt;a href="mailto:acalder1@my.bcit.ca" title="e-mail me!"&gt;
acalder1@my.bcit.ca

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

 </p>
</div>

<h2>Navigation (nav.inc)</h2>
<div class="content-block">
<h3>Use a CSS navigation scheme using an Unordered List</h3>

<p>Example Code:<br>

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="index.shtml"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="car.shtml"&gt;My First Car&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="links.shtml"&gt;Links&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

 </p>

<h3>Upload the files into your /inc folder</h3>

<p>Don't worry about linking the files yet.  That's next!  </p>
</div>

<h2>Adding the Include Statements</h2>
<div class="content-block">
<p>Start with your INDEX.SHTML file<br> 

Just below the &lt;body&gt; tag, enter the following:<br>

&lt;!--#include file="inc/head.inc" --&gt;</p>

 

<p>This will grab the file from that location, and place the code in the file as if it were actually part of the document.</p>

 

<p>Save and upload the file to your server.  Refresh the page.  Did the include file work?</p>

 

<p>Repeat the same for the footer and the navigation.  Place the include statement where you think they should actually go in the code.</p>
 

<p>Now change all your pages to include your header, navigation and footer includes.</p>

 

<h3>Bonus: Include today's date somewhere in the document. </h3>

<p>Hint: This can be done with:<br>

<ol>
	<li>1 tag (ECHO): long form date, or;</li>
	<li>2 tags (CONFIG and ECHO) a more 'configured' date</li>
</ol>

<h2>Homework - Part 1</h2>
<div class="content-block">
<p>Using the Realty Listing page you created last week, create a copy (just copy the whole directory) and use it for your homework this week.</p>
<p>Take the top-most and bottom-most parts of your page and put them in include files. Also, take the navigation out and put it inside an include file as well. Be sure that the include files work.</p>
<p>This will allow you to easily create a page in future with all of the same header and footer content but only ever having to create it once.</p>
</div>


<h2>Homework - Part 2</h2>
<div class="content-block">
<p>This week, you will create a gallery on your Realtor Listings page using the <a href="exercises/gallery.html">Gallery Exercise</a> as a guide.</p>
</div>

<h2>Homework - Part 3</h2>
<div class="content-block">
<p>Finally, create an account on <a href="http://tumblr.com">Tumblr</a> and add 3 separate text and 3 separate image posts</p>
</div>

            <div id="footer">
               <a href="#top">Top of Page</a> | <a href="/">Home</a>
